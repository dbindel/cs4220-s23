Suppose $A = M-N$ is a splitting and consider the stationary
iteration $M x_{k+1} = N x_k + b$.  Show that if $x_0 = 0$ then
\[
  x_k = \sum_{j=0}^k R^j M^{-1} b 
\]
where $R = M^{-1} N$.  Note: we can compute the partial sum in closed form
as
\[
  x_k = (I-R)^{-1} (I-R^{k+1}) M^{-1} b
\]
if $I-R$ is invertible -- but you don't need to prove this.
