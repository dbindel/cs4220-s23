Consider the (real) inner product on $\mathcal{P}_2$ defined by
\[
  \langle p, q \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 p(x) q(x) \, dx.
\]
A real inner product is a symmetric positive bilinear form,
so in any given basis it is represented by some symmetric positive
definite matrix $A$.  What is the matrix for this inner product
for the power basis?
