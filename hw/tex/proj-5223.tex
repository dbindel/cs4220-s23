\hdr{Project proposal (5223)}

The 5223 extra project is an opportunity for you to do a little extra something
related to the class and get some feedback on it.  This could be implementing a
numerical algorithm from a paper, extending a homework or project from the class,
or doing something for your research -- as long as it is connected to the topics
of this class.  The project is due at the end of the
semester, but should not be scoped as something that you think you will need
to spend all semester on!

For this submission, please just let me know what you are thinking of working on.  
A couple sentences is fine.  This is mostly an opportunity for me to provide
some pointers and feedback.
